 *   This is called the FVM, it's an alternative ABI.
 *   Originally, it was designed to compress calldata and therefore
 *   save gas on optimistic rollup networks.
 *
 *   There are levels to the optimizations that can be made for it,
 *   but this one focuses on the alternative multicall: jump process.
 *
 *   Multicalls will pad all calls to a full bytes32.
 *   This means two calls are at least 64 bytes.
 *   This alternative multicall can process over 10 calls in the same 64 bytes.
 *   The smallest bytes provided by a call is for allocate and deallocate, at 11 bytes.
 *
 *   Multicalls also process transactions sequentially.
 *   State cannot be carried over transiently between transactions.
 *   With FVM, we can transiently set state (only specific state),
 *   and use it across "instructions".
 *
 *   Without jump instruction, this alternative encoding is overkill.
 *
 *   Data is delivered via the `multiprocess` function in Portfolio.
